# OC_Projet_11 : Develop a web application with React and React Router

In this project we work for Kasa. Kasa is one of the leaders in private apartment rentals in France.
Kasa's website was coded more than 10 years ago in ASP.NET and they want to upgrade it to a full javascript stack. For this purpose we are therefore asked to manage the front-end part based on the models and details given for some features.

You can see the app [here](https://oc-projet-11.vercel.app/)


_July 2023 update : converted app to TypeScript_
